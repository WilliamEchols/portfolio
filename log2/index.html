            <h2>Natural Logarithm of 2</h2>
            
            <p>The natural log of 2, sometimes written as ln(2) or log(2), is an important constant in fields such as mathematics and computer science. It starts with the digits 0.69314 and continues infinitely.</p>

            <p>log(2) is a transcendental number, which means that it is not the root of any polynomial with rational coefficients. For our purposes, this means that it cannot be perfectly represented using a finite number of digits and its digits do not repeat. As a result, calculating its digits requires a lot of computational power. However, there are several known methods to calculate log(2) to arbitrary precision.</p>

            <h3>Putting theory into practice</h3>

            <p>Using <a href="http://www.numberworld.org/y-cruncher/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="highlight">y-cruncher</a>, I calculated 1.5 trillion digits of log(2) with this server:</p>

            </div>

            <table class="table-right">
                <tr>
                    <th>Processor</th>
                    <td>2x Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2690 v3 @ 2.60GHz</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>Topology</th>
                    <td>48 threads / 24 cores / 2 sockets</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>Usable Memory</th>
                    <td>252 GiB</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>Usable Storage</th>
                    <td>~200 TiB</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <p>In order to easily structure and partition the server, I used Proxmox (a hypervisor: a program that allows you to manage virtual machines) to run an Ubuntu container allocated with the full server's resources. In order to meet Numberworld's standards for record submission, I ran the calculation twice:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
		  The first calculation used the <i>Primary Machin-like Formula (3 terms)</i> algorithm provided by y-cruncher.

		  \[ \log(2) = 18 \mathrm{ArcCoth}(26) - 2 \mathrm{ArcCoth}(4801) + 8 \mathrm{ArcCoth}(8749) \]
		</li>
                <li>
		  The second calculation used the <i>Secondary Machin-like Formula (4 terms)</i> algorithm (also provided by y-cruncher) for verification.

		  \[ \log(2) = 144 \mathrm{ArcCoth}(251) + 54 \mathrm{ArcCoth}(449) - 38 \mathrm{ArcCoth}(4801) + 62 \mathrm{ArcCoth}(8749) \]
		</li>
            </ol>

            <p>The results from these calculations matched perfectly, indicating that the computation was successful. Here are some interesting stats from these computations:</p>

            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Algorithm</th>

                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Primary Machin-like Formula</td>

                    <td>97.4%</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Secondary Machin-like Formula</td>
                    <td>823 TiB</td>
                    <td>728 TiB</td>
                    <td>53.6 days</td>
                    <td>87.0%</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <p>Over the course of the calculations, nearly 1.5 PiB (~1.5 million gigabytes) of data was read and written to the hard drives, causing many of the already-used disks to fail. Thankfully, I had expected some drive failures so I had partitioned the disks with RAID (redundancy to prevent data loss) before starting the calculations.</p>

            <h3>Results</h3>

            <p>Here are the last digits I computed (numbered 1,499,999,999,901 to 1,500,000,000,000), broken into groups of 10 for clarity:</p>

            <h3>Aftermath</h3>

            <p>This computation held the record for the most digits of log(2) ever calculated, starting from September 9, 2021 and lasting until February 12, 2024 (for a total of 886 days), when <a href="https://www.numberworld.org/y-cruncher/#Records" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="highlight">Jordan Ranous</a> successfully calculated 3 trillion digits of log(2) in just 90 hours! As of the time of this writing, his record still stands.</p>
